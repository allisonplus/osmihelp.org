# OSMI Docs in Markdown

Our preferred source format for documents we create is Markdown. Sometimes that will mean taking a source document in another format -- like a Word doc -- and converting it into *clean, semantic Markdown*. While it's possible to convert most word processing formats into HTML, and then convert HTML into Markdown (see <https://domchristie.github.io/to-markdown/>), there is a lot of HTML cruft left over, and the original author's intent can be lost (missing indentation, sizing etc.). To that end, we should provide a PDF that shows the original author's intent, and then use that as a guide for cleaning up the generated Markdown.

Right now we have two documents that need conversion:

1. ADA-Guidelines-Employers.md **(DO THIS FIRST)**
2. ADA-Guidelines-Employees.md

Both of these files started out as Google Docs files, were exported to HTML, and run through <https://domchristie.github.io/to-markdown/>. They still need a lot of cleanup, and the PDF files should be referenced to check the author's intent.

Thanks!!!!!!!

# Section I - Introduction

## Why support mental wellness in Tech?

One in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental illness in any given year (National Alliance on Mental Health, 2013). In the tech industry, 50% of individuals have sought treatment for mental illness, according to one study (Finkler, 2015). This represents a significant portion of your human talent pool – and very likely includes folks you already know well and have high regard for. Despite these statistics, mental wellness is not being discussed widely in the tech community. Taboos, lack of knowledge, desire not to intrude, and just plain not knowing how to talk about it all impede our ability to have important conversations – both for the employees and for the leaders, working groups and organizations that are impacted.

Only 26% of those working in tech are aware of their company’s mental health resources and how to seek help (Finkler, 2015). In addition to helping the employee, addressing employee needs can help you reduce turnover, absenteeism, and increase productivity within your organization (WHO, 2005). Mental health can impact even the most competent and productive employees and creating a culture in which they can continue to contribute is vital. Once we become aware as a society and community that people who struggle with mental illness are entitled to the same rights and resources as those suffering from any other health issue, the conversation, the culture, and the contributions will improve.

The intention of this document is to help you frame these needs and the discussions surrounding them, as well as to highlight resources you and employees can draw from to help in the process.

## Who is this handbook for?

- employers;

- employees;

- human resources professionals;

- occupational health professionals;

- mental health professionals;

- Groups representing people with mental health disorders;

- representatives or associations of families and carers of people with mental disorders;

- advocacy organizations representing the interests of people with mental disorders, and their families

# Section II - Precursors  for organizational success in addressing mental wellness

1. **Buy-in from C-Level executives.** As with any organizational change, if there is not buy-in from top leadership, there is unlikely to be sustainable change. Therefore, relevant and succinct research, policies, and implications should be shared with senior leadership – through appropriate channels – to build buy-in and begin to shift the culture from the top down.

2. **Knowing the laws.** Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 prohibits private employers, state and local governments, employment agencies and labor unions from discriminating against qualified individuals with disabilities in job application procedures, hiring, firing, advancement, compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment. As an additional part of this “working handbook” we have created an extensive document to enhance your understanding of the legal rights and responsibilities of both employers and employees [found here](https://osmihelp.org/resources).

3. **Consolidate resources and information** so that employees can easily and privately access useful information, policies, and tools to assist them in getting treatment. A preliminary list of resources can be found in Section V [link].

# Section III - Putting in place a mental health policy

The [World Health Organization](http://www.who.int/mental_health/policy/services/13_policies%2520programs%2520in%2520workplace_WEB_07.pdf) (2005) advises the development of a mental health policy for any business or organization wishing to improve mental wellness. Developing  a policy is the first step to addressing mental health in an organization. The vision for improving mental health in the workforce and creating a model for action should be addressed in the policy. A mental health policy for the workplace can be developed separately, or as part of a broader health and safety policy. Following are steps outlined by the WHO for putting in place a mental wellness policy:

**Step I:** Analysing the mental health issues.

**Step II:** Developing the policy.

**Step III:** Developing strategies to implement the policy.

**Step IV:** Implementing and evaluating the policy.

## Analyzing mental health issues (WHO, 2005)

It is important to make the case for developing a mental health policy in the workplace in order to gain the explicit endorsement and commitment of the employer and other key stakeholders. The employer is more likely to support the development of a policy if its potential cost impact can be demonstrated. In making the business case, general data showing the link between mental ill-health and reduced productivity and increased costs should be presented. In addition, any readily available data from the workplace itself should be analysed and presented in order to make the business case. A detailed assessment of mental health issues in the workplace, however, may not be possible until the commitment of management has been secured. A coordinating body, such as a steering committee or working group, should be established to guide the assessment of the workforce, facilitate consultation with the various stakeholders and coordinate the development of the workplace mental health policy. This body should ensure that all key stakeholders are involved in developing the policy.

The workplace mental health policy needs to be based on a comprehensive understanding of the issues, derived from a detailed assessment of the situation. All available relevant information should be assembled. Such information might include: human resources data (e.g. absenteeism records or number of resignations); occupational health and safety data (e.g. accidents or risk assessments), financial data (e.g. the cost of replacing employees who are on long-term disability leave) and health data (e.g. common health problems among the workforce). It may be necessary to collect new information through, for example, surveys on the incidence and prevalence of mental health problems in the workplace; risk assessments to identify occupational health and safety issues in the work environment; interviews or focus group discussions with key informants, such as employees, their families, managers, and medical personnel within the organization.

## Developing the policy (WHO, 2005)

A workplace mental health policy usually comprises a vision statement, a statement of the values and principles on which the policy will be based, and a set of objectives. These components need not be dealt with sequentially; often they are developed simultaneously. The vision statement presents a general image of the future of mental health in the workplace. It should set high expectations as to what can be achieved, while at the same time being realistic. It is often difficult to achieve a common vision among stakeholders who may have diverse interests and perspectives. It is essential that all stakeholders have input to the vision. An active compromise among the majority of stakeholders may be necessary if the policy is to be successfully implemented.

Values and principles form the basis for the development of objectives and strategies. Values refer to judgements or beliefs about what is considered worth-while or desirable, and principles refer to the standards or rules that guide actions, and should ultimately emanate from the values. Workplaces have their own values and culture, which should be reflected in a policy. The values and principles underlying the workplace mental health policy should strike a balance between the various interests of the different stakeholders.

Objectives translate the policy vision into concrete statements of what is to be achieved. Objectives should respond to the identified issues and aim to improve the mental health of the workforce. They should be specific and achievable within a specified timeframe of the policy. During the process of formulating the vision, values, principles and objectives, it is essential to consult with all stakeholders. Key stakeholders should be identified early and involved in the analysis and assessment of the mental health needs in the workplace. Consultations should continue throughout the process of developing the policy.

## Developing strategies to implement the policy (WHO, 2005)

Once the mental health policy has been developed, strategies are needed to implement it. The strategies are the core of any mental health plan. The first task is to review the options for strategies, which can be divided into five main categories:

1. increasing employee awareness of mental health issues;

1. supporting employees at risk;

1. providing treatment for employees with a mental health problem;

1. changing the organization of work;

1. reintegrating employees with a mental health problem into the workplace.

The specific strategies chosen will depend on the needs of the business and its employees and the resources available.

Next, it is important to ensure that sufficient resources are available to implement the strategies. This requires a clear understanding of both the strategies to be implemented and the associated costs. The resources needed might include additional financing (for example, to establish an employee assistance programme) or the redirection of funds that are currently used elsewhere (for example, negotiating with health clinic staff to conduct a mental health awareness campaign). Finally, the plan to implement the policy has to be formulated. The plan should outline the objectives, specific strategies to be used, targets to be achieved and activities to be carried out. The timeframe, responsible people, outputs and potential obstacles should be clearly identified.

## Implementing and evaluating the policy (WHO, 2005)

The main actions in implementing and evaluating a mental health policy in the workplace include:

- generating support and collaboration;

- coordinating implementation;

- training;

- establishing a demonstration project; and

- evaluating the outcomes

The mental health policy needs to be disseminated and communicated to all stakeholders. Many policies fail because they are poorly communicated. Some approaches to communication are listed below.

- Organize an event to launch the policy

- Distribute posters and leaflets outlining the policy

- Hold meetings with different groups of employees to explain the policy

- Publish the policy on the company’s website

The implementation process needs to be carefully coordinated and monitored. The plan should be reviewed and updated as necessary. A process for implementation should be established. An individual, a department or a committee might be given responsibility for the implementation of the plan. Regular reporting to the employer, employees, and funders of the policy should be part of the implementation plan. It is important to ensure that the people who will be leading the implementation process are properly trained to understand the issues associated with mental health in the workplace. A range of stakeholders may benefit from training at this stage, including:

- health workers,

- human resource personnel,

- managers and supervisors,

- union delegates,

- occupational health and safety representatives.

It is often useful to set up a demonstration project to implement a strategy in one part of the company. Such a project can often be implemented rapidly and thoroughly evaluated. The demonstration project may target a particular group of employees (for example, administrative staff) or a specific department. The demonstration project may also be used as an advocacy tool, to illustrate the value of specific strategies; as a training area for the implementation of the plan; and to provide detailed guidance for other parts of the workplace on implementing specific strategies. It is important to evaluate the effect of the policy and strategies on individual workers and on the organization. This will also assist in building an evidence base of effective mental health interventions in the workplace. Ideally, the evaluation should be planned when the policy is being developed, and should contain both quantitative and qualitative elements.

## Mental Health in the Workplace: Example Accommodations (OSMI, 2016)

Accommodations are often necessary for employees with mental health impairments to be successful at work. Accommodations can be considered for all  employees, regardless of mental health impairment status. Below are example accommodations outlined by OSMI in the [ADA Employer Handbook](https://osmihelp.org/resources/ada-employers-guide/). Not all accommodations are feasible for organizations to offer. Consideration for the inclusion of some accommodations can contribute to the mental wellness of all employees.

#### Working Effectively:

Two common issues that JAN receives inquiries on are: (1) what accommodations will work for individuals with mental health impairments when workplaces are implementing substantial changes, and (2) what accommodations will help supervisors work effectively with individuals with mental health impairments. Many accommodation ideas are born from effective management techniques. When organizations are implementing workplace changes, it is important that key personnel recognize that a change in the environment or in supervisors may be difficult. Maintaining open channels of communication to ensure any transitions are smooth, and providing short weekly or monthly meetings with employees to discuss workplace issues can be helpful.

Supervisors can also implement management techniques that support an inclusive workplace culture while simultaneously providing accommodations. Techniques include the following:

*   Provide positive praise and reinforcement,
*   Provide day-to-day guidance and feedback,
*   Provide written job instructions via email,
*   Develop clear expectations of responsibilities and the consequences of not meeting performance standards,
*   Schedule consistent meetings with employee to set goals and review progress,
*   Allow for open communication,
*   Establish written long term and short term goals,
*   Develop strategies to deal with conflict,
*   Develop a procedure to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodation,
*   Educate all employees on their right to accommodations,
*   Provide sensitivity training to coworkers and supervisors,
*   Do not mandate that employees attend work related social functions, and
*   Encourage all employees to move non-work-related conversations out of work areas.



# Section IV - Leadership Communication Tips 101

You have a threefold responsibility with regards to your employees’ health:

1. Ensuring you have a workplace that meets all the legal requirements and responsibilities for employee mental health – including policies, tools, and resources. Reference [OSMI ADA Employer Handbook](https://osmihelp.org/resources/ada-employers-guide/) for more information.

2. Building a culture that supports employee well-being. This includes the legal and compliance resources above, but goes well beyond this – incorporating values and assumptions and ways of operating that make it clear that every individual’s health is valued. This includes building a supportive environment in which all competent employees can contribute and feel valued, despite mental health struggles they may be facing.

    Just a few clear signs you are creating a culture encouraging employee wellness are that:

    -   Wellness policies and resources are clear to employees.
    -   Mental health resources are available.
    -   Workplace values discourage “work hour martyrdom;” encourage employees taking vacation and sick days, validate open-ness and candor, and discourage even inadvertent insults and jokes about mental health.
    -   There is transparency in hiring processes and in company practices related to health and well-being

3. Personally becoming a person who can have candid conversations supporting employees with mental health issues. If you find this is outside your capability, then ensuring there other leaders who can have these supportive, informative conversations that direct employees to useful resources and to a sense of acceptance within the workplace.

## Having “the conversation”:

1.  If an employee approaches you regarding their mental health struggles, your byword should be compassion and open-ness. This does not mean that you commit to resources or policies that you are not aware of or that you can not offer. It does mean that you recognize that this fellow human has come to you with a vulnerability that is very difficult to summon and they probably are able to do this from a combination of courage, competence, self-reflection, and pain.
2.  If you do not have information or resources to share, let them know that – and that you will get back to them with expedience.
3.  Next, determine what your legal responsibilities are and what resources you or the company can access to assist your employee. (The purpose of this document is to assist you in this).
4.  And then, get back to the employee within 24 hours to follow-up and let them know either specifics or where you are in determining them. Follow up every 24 hours until you have clear information and support to offer.
5.  After your employee has gotten assistance, follow up to determine whether there is more you or the company can provide (within your legal and financial capabilities). This might happen a day, a week, or a month later – but ensure that you do follow up – both to offer support to the employee and because this support will likely lead to future productivity and commitment from this valuable human resource.

# Section V - Leading by example: Companies doing it right

It is no surprise that mental wellness is gaining increasing attraction across tech. Afterall, happy employees are known to be more productive and innovative. The following companies have committed to the well-being of their employees through a range of activities, benefits, supports and incentives.

1.  [Keen IO](https://keen.io/)

    -   Keen has developed a coaching program with three coaches available to their 50 employees (including one doctoral-level psychologist) on staff and available to work with any employee in need, either on a regular basis or ad-hoc. Coaching is opt-in and 95% of the company works with a coach regularly. It is often referred to as the number one perk of working for the Keen. A newly developed peer-coaching program encourages employees to support each other through an introspective process guided by the company coaches.
    -   “Anxious and Excited” or “A&E” (sometimes referred to as “Introspection Happy Hour”) is implemented weekly at the end of the day on Thursdays, for all employees to share their anxieties and excitements. It encourages personal introspection, relatedness, and empathy. It is not a time to solution but rather a time to listen, share, and support one another.
    -   The People Developers at Keen offer Learning Labs as core curriculum. Topics include Effective Communication [link] and [Managing Emotions](http://learn.keen.io/keen-learning-lab-managing-emotions). Employees learn non-violent communication techniques, methods for delivering feedback, conflict resolution techniques, trust building models, cognitive models for regulation, and mindfulness. Employees establish a common language used to address conflict or disagreement in the workplace, for communicating emotions and regulating when appropriate and improve awareness of others and self. These trainings have been open to the public as well.
    -   Organizational values align with mental wellness. At Keen IO, company [values](https://keen.io/blog/141443530686/how-values-help-you-scale-and-maintain-your) were developed to drive a happy culture, which  in turn produces happy employees. Introspection, Continuous learning, Honesty, Personal agency, and Empathy are communicated by behavior, while also driving behavior. The culture constructed from these values is an output of behaviors, structures, processes, reward systems, philosophies, and group norms that are executed day after day within the organization. These values define how Keen employees approach the product, sales, organizational development, and personal development..
    -   Keen implements Active Living Days in April, which falls between President’s day and Memorial day, the longest stretch over the year without a holiday. Employees are encouraged to be active together and multiple activities are typically organized (e.g., hiking trip, day at the trapeze park, bike ride, etc). Active Living Funds are a monthly stipend to be used towards anything encouraging an active life, whether it be a gym membership, a new bike, a trip to Colorado for hiking, or a new pair of dumbbells for the house.
    -   Keen has a generous maternity/paternity leave of five months paid leave for all new parents.
    -   Flexible hours. Employees are able to customize their hours and location based on preferences and needs. Some work from home in the mornings to be most productive and head to the office in the afternoon for in person meetings. Some employees work completely remotely.
    -   Keen has an unlimited vacation policy and mandates three weeks minimal and “unplugged” leave.

2.  [Olark](https://www.olark.com/)

    -   Olark has an explicit focus on its employees and their wellbeing
    -   Learning opportunities are provided around mental illness and support
    -   Flexible work hours and schedules allow employees to work in a way that makes them most successful
    -   Mental health is outlined as a valid reason for taking time from work
    -   Each employee has 1:1 conversations with another employee/coach in the company

# Section VI - Resources

Fortunately, a myriad of resources are available for managers and senior leaders who would like to create an environment that helps every individual work toward both optimal performance and optimal mental health. This is NOT a complete or “certified” approach to this, but below you will find:

*   Research and policy information about mental health in the workplace
*   Specific organizations and resources employees can draw upon for improved health
*   Steps and tools employers can utilize to change the mental health culture of the workplace

## Changing your business culture

*Businesses Materials for a Mental Health Friendly Workplace: Executives Booklet*: [http://promoteacceptance.samhsa.gov/publications/business_execs.aspx?printid=1&](http://promoteacceptance.samhsa.gov/publications/business_execs.aspx?printid%3D1%26) 

In addition to resources and tips for businesses of different sizes, it lays out common myths (and falsehoods) about mental illness.


## Myths Surrounding Mental Illnesses

*Myth*: People with mental illnesses can't hold jobs.

***Fact***: On the contrary, many are productive employees, business owners, and contributing members of their communities.

*Myth*: Employees with mental illnesses, even those who have received effective treatment and have recovered, tend to be second-rate workers.

***Fact***: Employers who have hired these individuals report they are higher than average in attendance and punctuality, and they are as good or better than other employees in motivation, quality of work, and job tenure. Studies reported by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) conclude that there are no differences in productivity when compared to other employees.

*Myth*: There's no hope for people with mental illnesses.

***Fact***: There are more treatments, strategies, and community supports than ever before, and even more are on the horizon. People with mental illnesses lead active, productive lives.

*Myth*: People with mental illnesses are violent and unpredictable.

***Fact***: Chances are you know someone with a mental illness and don't even realize it. In reality, the vast majority of people who have mental illnesses are no more violent than anyone else.


## American Psychological Association (extensive materials)

The American Psychological Association has materials and guidelines for creating an understanding psychological needs in your workplace: [http://www.apaexcellence.org/resources/creatingahealthyworkplace/](http://www.apaexcellence.org/resources/creatingahealthyworkplace/) 

Excerpts from this site state:

1.  No “one-size-fits-all” approach to creating a psychologically healthy workplace… address challenges unique to your organization; tailor programs and policies to meet your needs

2.  Reduce turnover: “Two-thirds of both men and women say work has a significant impact on their stress level, and one in four has called in sick or taken a “mental health day” as a result of work stress. Also a significant concern for employers, job stress is estimated to cost U.S. industry $300 billion a year in absenteeism, diminished productivity, employee turnover and direct medical, legal and insurance fees… (S)kyrocketing healthcare costs, global competition and economic uncertainty, employers are concerned about attracting and retaining high-quality employees and keeping up morale. **Minimizing workplace stress** plays a **significant role in the employee retention equation** as organizations look to optimize their human capital… creating workplaces that do more than just improve productivity – they build a strong, vibrant organizational culture that supports the company itself. In short, they build a psychologically healthy workplace.

3.  **Communication KEY** role in success of any workplace program or policy;  and serves as the foundation for all five types of psychologically healthy workplace practices: [http://www.apaexcellence.org/resources/creatingahealthyworkplace/theroleofcommunication/](http://www.apaexcellence.org/resources/creatingahealthyworkplace/theroleofcommunication/)

    -   Bottom-up communication (from employees to management): employee needs, values, perceptions and opinions

    -   Top-down communication (from management to employees): make employees aware of workplace programs, demonstrate management supports and values

        Communication strategies:

        +   Regular, **on-going opportunities for employees provide feedback** (surveys, suggestion boxes, town hall meetings, individual or small group meeting with managers, culture that supports open, two-way communication)
        +   **Goals and actions** of organization/senior leadership **clear** to workers; policies facilitate transparency
        +   **Assess needs** of employees and **involve them** in development of psychologically healthy workplace
        +   **Multiple channels re. importance** of psychologically healthy workplace
        +   **Lead by example**, leaders participate in psychologically healthy workplace activities, visible to employees
        +   Information about **success of** specific psychologically healthy workplace practices

1.  In particular, for **mental health support**, APA has created this information: [http://www.apaexcellence.org/resources/creatingahealthyworkplace/healthandsafety/](http://www.apaexcellence.org/resources/creatingahealthyworkplace/healthandsafety/) 

    -   “Health and safety initiatives maximize the physical and mental health of employees through the prevention, assessment, and treatment of potential health risks and problems and by encouraging and supporting healthy lifestyle and behavior choices....By investing in the health and safety of their employees, organizations may benefit from greater productivity and reductions in healthcare costs, absenteeism and accident/injury rates.
        +   **Lead by example**, leaders participate in psychologically healthy workplace activities, visible to employees
        +   Information about **success** of specific psychologically healthy workplace practices

                <p>OSMI began in 2013 as a speaking campaign by Ed Finkler. Ed started <a href="/talks">speaking at tech conferences</a> about his
                    personal experiences as a web developer and open source advocate with a mental health disorder.
                    The response was overwhelming, and Ed has continued to speak, gather data, and organize efforts
                    to change experiences of those with mental health disorders in the tech workplace. This includes
                    <strong>speaking at conferences and companies</strong>, <strong><a href="/research">conducting research</a></strong>, and
                    <strong><a href="/resources">creating documentation</a></strong> to assist
                    companies in making supportive environments for those impacted by mental health disorders.  He is
                    assisted in these efforts by selfless <a href="#volunteers">volunteers</a> who bring their time and expertise to bear on this important issue.
